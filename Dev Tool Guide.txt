RUNNING AND EXECUTION
The dev tool is compiled and ran the same way as a normal game instance: make, then ./bin/myGame.
To switch between a normal game instance and running the dev tool, go to main.cpp and make sure
the correct line for dev tool is commented out.

REFRESHING RESOURCES
Due to the fact that C++ has no good, cross-platform solution for accessing the file system, 
a python script was used to list out all of the sprites in the resources/Sprites folder, and
print out these file paths to a file called resources.txt. Whenever, you add a sprite to the
resources/Sprite folder, this file must be refreshed so the dev tool can see the new file. To
do this, run: 
make refresh-resources

If you cannot run the make target, you can run the script directly with:
python3 scripts/refresh_resources.py

BASIC USAGE
-Sprites are added by dragging sprites from the bar on the top into the grid.
NOTE: when the sprite is first added onto the grid, the location of the sprite
may be wonky, so you may need to zoom out to see it

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
-Zoom in/out: v, b
-Pan around scene: arrow keys
-Scale selected sprite: W, A, S, D
-Delete selected sprite: X
-Page through sprites on the bar: 1, 2


TERMINAL COMMANDS (type the command into the terminal while the dev tool is running)
-Load Scene: "load", then the name of the json file when prompted
-Save Scene: "save", then the name of the json file when prompted
-Updating ID of selected Sprite: "id" , then the new id when prompted (useful for when you want to refer to that sprite later on)
-Changing layer: "layer fg", "layer mg", or "layer bg": (changes which layer new sprites will be added to, foreground, midground,
or background


TBD:
-rotating sprites
-adding animations
-specifiying parent/child relationships
